# Century-Dice
## Overview
Century Dice is a captivating and competitive dice game that pits two players in a race to score a century of points. This browser-based game transforms a simple roll of the dice into a suspenseful journey towards victory. Each turn is a mix of risk and reward, as players decide whether to bank their points or roll again for a higher score. The game is intuitive yet unpredictable, offering endless fun as players strategize to outmaneuver each other on their way to 100 points.

## How to Play

- If a player rolls a 1, they forfeit the temporary score and pass the turn.
- Rolling any other number adds to the temporary score, which can be 'held' to add to the total score.
- The goal is to reach or exceed 100 points to win the game.

## Features
